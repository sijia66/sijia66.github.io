I think first of all, we had a deeper understanding of pain and suffering. The teacher Lauren quoted Budda that we cannot avoid pain because pain is universal and according to book flow, the university does not optimize its operation or laws of physics to alleviate human pain. However, Budda said that we can reduce suffering. In my understanding, suffering is our perception and reaction to pain. My finger got bitten; it becomes suffering if I fixate on it all day long and it then becomes suffering.  It’s certainly painful to break up with ex girl friend.  It then becomes suffering if one carries that heartbroken feelings all day long. Not only pain becomes suffering but also suffering becomes torture. This is the first noble truth that suffering exists. 

Why do we suffer?  According to Budda, the second noble truth says that we suffer because we attach and cling either to material or idealistic things.  For material goods, I always wanted a better phone where in fact, my phone is pretty good at  the moment. The longing or clining to a new phone is a form of suffering because in reality I don’t have it and that gap caused me to constantly think about it, watching youtube videos and things.  For immaterial ideas, I cling to good health, cling to gathering of friends and family.  But in reality, we meet more and gather less. In addition, I often cling to an ideal form of myself. That ideal form is always intelligent, charming, energetic,  but no. In reality, I am just some lazy guy, alright. Recently, I have noticed that being lazy is a form of attachment.  If I am lazy and procrastinating, I am attached to my current comforts such as physical comforts like the sofa, the chair and psychological comforts of avoiding risks,  not wanting to accept judgements. And the last one is actually a big one.  

The third and last noble truths are the ending of suffering.  The key is to let go of these idiosyncrasies.  When a craving for a new phone arises, take a moment to pause and take a deep breath; and don’t react to it.  One small group participant says non-reaction to one craving probably does not make the craving go away; but it does help to loosen the grip of that craving; over many many tries, we can eventually detach from that craving. And this is the way to let go. Every time we tried to loosen the grip, we can feel a sense of freedom.  That is true freedom, freedom from our own cravings.
